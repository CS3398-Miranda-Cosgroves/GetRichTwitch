# GetRichTwitch
GetRichTwitch

Description: GetRichTwitch is an automated system, commonly known as a “bot”, made by the Miranda Cosgroves team at Texas State
that monitors activity on the Twitch.tv site and aggregates the data in an easily digestible format. It monitors the chat content 
for trigger strings to drive input and responses to control things such as games, moderator controls, donation tracking, etc. 
This project aims to use image processing and machine learning to track donations and subscribers of users on twitch to estimate
their income over different time frames, as well as to estimate the potential and mean values for incomes streams of different 
times and games played.

Currently the code can be built and runs without errors.

Joel Martinez: "I plan on implementing subscriper detection and part of the Youtube API."
For this sprint completed the gamble function and I helped debug code.

Eric Ross: "I plan on finishing my research for the Spotify API, at which point I will start the code relating to the Spotify API."
I wrote the !hug and !haiku functions, along with researching the Spotify API.

Cody Jandt: "I will be working on getting !givepts more functionality, such as storing points gained and a timer that only will allow 
users to call !givepts only once every 10-15 minutes."
I wrote the !givepts and !doom function and help coordinate whether or not we should implement Spotify third-party extensions.

Levi Stalsworth: "I will research back end options for creating a way to not have to use JavaScript for data managment,
and implementing it as I gain the knowledge and availability."
I wrote the !coinflip and !slap functions and helped research the spotify and youtube APIs. !status was not able to be implemented
correctly without the back end working, so it's under jurisdiction of my part of the next sprint. I learned JavaScript is terrible.

Michael Griffith: "I will work with the Google API and HTML files to take data from users in the IRC and convert it
into useable API calls on Google services such as Youtube."

(5pts–Indvidual) With specific, measurable improvement action described 
Cody- I know that I have a problem with spacing out projects, I need to spread out my time more efficiently by spacing my projects out 
and using a calender would help.
