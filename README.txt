GetRichTwitch

Description: GetRichTwitch is an automated system, commonly known as a “bot”, made by the Miranda Cosgroves team at Texas State
that monitors activity on the Twitch.tv site and aggregates the data in an easily digestible format. It monitors the chat content 
for trigger strings to drive input and responses to control things such as games, moderator controls, donation tracking, etc. This 
project aims to use image processing and machine learning to track donations and subscribers of users on twitch to estimate their 
income over different time frames, as well as to estimate the potential and mean values for incomes streams of different times and games played.
